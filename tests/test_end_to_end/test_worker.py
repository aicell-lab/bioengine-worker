End-to-end tests for BioEngine Worker main component.

This module tests the core BioEngineWorker functionality through the Hypha service API,
including worker readiness checks, status monitoring, worker lifecycle management,
and comprehensive worker operations.

    Test calling the is_ready function on the BioEngine worker.
    
    This test validates:
    1. Worker readiness status through is_ready API
    2. Boolean response indicating worker initialization state
    3. Service availability and responsiveness
    4. Proper worker lifecycle state management
    5. Readiness signal accuracy
    
    Steps:
    - Connect to Hypha server and get worker service
    - Call is_ready function on the worker service
    - Verify boolean response (should be True for running worker)
    - Check response timing and consistency
    - Validate readiness correlates with worker functionality
