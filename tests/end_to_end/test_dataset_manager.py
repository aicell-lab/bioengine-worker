    """
    Test loading the 'blood' dataset and interacting with it through the HTTP API.

    This test validates:
    1. Connecting to the Hypha server
    2. Accessing the BioEngine worker service
    3. Loading the 'blood' dataset
    4. Verifying the dataset URL is returned
    5. Making HTTP requests to the dataset service
    6. Retrieving dataset metadata and file information
    7. Accessing dataset files through the HTTP interface
    8. Verifying dataset content and structure

    Steps:
    - Call load_dataset with dataset_id="blood"
    - Verify successful dataset loading
    - Validate the returned dataset URL format
    - Get the dataset HTTP service URL
    - Make authenticated HTTP requests to dataset endpoints
    - Retrieve dataset manifest and file listings
    - Access individual files and verify content
    - Test dataset browsing functionality

    Test closing the 'blood' dataset to free resources.

    This test validates:
    1. Loading the 'blood' dataset first
    2. Closing the dataset using close_dataset API
    3. Verifying the dataset is no longer accessible
    4. Confirming resources are properly freed
    5. Testing that subsequent access attempts fail appropriately

    Steps:
    - Load the 'blood' dataset
    - Verify dataset is accessible
    - Call close_dataset with dataset_id="blood"
    - Verify successful closure response
    - Attempt to access closed dataset (should fail)
    - Check that resources are freed from worker status

    Test loading the 'blood' dataset and then performing cleanup operation.

    This test validates:
    1. Loading the 'blood' dataset
    2. Verifying dataset is properly loaded
    3. Calling cleanup_datasets to close all open datasets
    4. Confirming all datasets are closed after cleanup
    5. Verifying system returns to clean state

    Steps:
    - Load the 'blood' dataset
    - Verify dataset is accessible and listed in worker status
    - Call cleanup_datasets on the worker service
    - Verify successful cleanup response
    - Check that no datasets remain open in worker status
